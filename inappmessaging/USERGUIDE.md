# In-App Messaging
In-App Messaging (IAM) module allows app developers to easily configure and display notifications within their app.

![In-App Messaging Sample](images/what-is-inapp.png)

### This page covers:
* [Requirements](#requirements)
* [SDK Integration](#integration)
* [Advanced Features](#advanced)
* [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
* [FAQ](#faq)
* [Documentation and Useful Links](#see-also)
* [Change Log](#changelog)

## <a name="requirements"></a> Requirements
### Supported Android Versions
This SDK supports Android API level 21 (Lollipop) and above.

### In-App Messaging Subscription Key
You must have a subscription key for your application from IAM Dashboard.

## <a name="integration"></a> SDK Integration
### #1 Include JCenter repo in your project, this should be added in your project root `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
```

### #2 Add InAppMessaging SDK in your project dependencies.

Note: InAppMessaging SDK only uses AndroidX libraries. Host apps should migrate to AndroidX to avoid duplicate dependencies.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.rakuten.tech.mobile.inappmessaging:inappmessaging:${latest_version}'
}
```
Please refer to [Changelog](#changelog) section for the latest version.

### #3 Target and compile SDK version to 28 or above.
Note: It is required to target and compile to SDK version 28 or above.

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 28

    defaultConfig {
    // Defines the minimum API level required to run the app.
    minSdkVersion 21
    // Specifies the API level used to test the app.
    targetSdkVersion 28
    }
}
```

### #4 Adding subscription ID and config URL to your app's AndroidManifest.xml file.

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.rakuten.tech.mobile.inappmessaging.subscriptionkey"
    android:value="change-to-your-subsrcription-key"/>

<meta-data
    android:name="com.rakuten.tech.mobile.inappmessaging.configurl"
    android:value="change-to-config-url"/>
```

If you want to enable debug logging in In-App Messaging SDK (tags begins with "IAM_"), add the following meta-data in AndroidManifest.xml file.
```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.rakuten.tech.mobile.inappmessaging.debugging"
    android:value="true"/>
```

| Field            | Datatype| Manifest Key                                             | Optional   | Default |
|------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------|
| Subscription Key | String  | `com.rakuten.tech.mobile.inappmessaging.subscriptionkey` | ‚ùå         | üö´      |
| Config URL       | String  | `com.rakuten.tech.mobile.inappmessaging.configurl`       | ‚ùå         | üö´      |
| Debugging        | boolean | `com.rakuten.tech.mobile.inappmessaging.debugging`       | ‚úÖ         | `false` |

### #5 <a name="info-provider"></a> Creating UserInfoProvider.
Create a new class in your project that implements the following class:
```kotlin
com.rakuten.tech.mobile.inappmessaging.runtime.UserInfoProvider
```

This class serves the purpose of providing basic user information such as user ID, Rakuten ID, and RAE Token at runtime. These user information are used by the SDK for campaigns targeting specific users.

```kotlin
class AppUserInfoProvider : UserInfoProvider {

    override fun provideRaeToken(): String? {
        return raeToken
    }

    override fun provideUserId(): String? {
        return userId
    }
    override fun provideRakutenId(): String? {
        return rakutenId
    }
}
```

* Rakuten ID - Any value that is considered by the app as user identifier.
* User ID - The ID when registering a Rakuten account (e.g. email address or username).
* RAE Token - This is the token provided by the internal User SDK as the "authentication token" value.

**<font color="red">Notes for Rakuten Developers:</font>**
* **Only provide RAE token if the user is logged in.**
* **The internal IAM backend only supports production RAE token.**

### #6 Initializing In-App Messaging SDK.
In-App Messaging is automatically initialized at startup and handled on a background thread.
Host app just needs to register the provider containing the user information.

In your Application's `onCreate()` method, add:

```kotlin
InAppMessaging.instance().registerPreference(YourUserInfoProvider())
```

**<font color="red">Note:</font> There could be exceptions thrown during initialization, if Subscription Key or other critical information was not found.**

### #7 Registering and unregistering activities.
Only register activities that are allowed to display In-App messages. Your activities will be kept in a `WeakReference` object, so it will not cause any memory leaks. Don't forget to unregister your activities in `onPause()` method.

Please see [Context](#context) feature section to have more control on displaying campaigns.

```kotlin
override fun onResume() {
    super.onResume()
    InAppMessaging.instance().registerMessageDisplayActivity(this)
}

override fun onPause() {
    super.onPause()
    InAppMessaging.instance().unregisterMessageDisplayActivity()
}
```

### #8 Logging events
Host app can log events to InAppMessaging anywhere in your app.

These events will trigger messages with the same event based trigger. Upon receiving logged event, InAppMessaging SDK will start matching it with current campaigns immediately. After a campaign message's trigger events are matched by the logged events, this message will be displayed in the current registered activity. If no activity is registered, it will be displayed in the next registered activity.

### Pre-defined event classes:<br/>
### `AppStartEvent`
Host app should log this event on app launch from terminated state. Recommended to log this event in host app's main activity's `Activity#onStart()`.

App Start Event is persistent, meaning, once it's logged it will always satisfy corresponding trigger in a campaign. All subsequent logs of this event are ignored. Campaigns that require only AppStartEvent are shown once per app session.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onStart() {
        super.onStart()
        InAppMessaging.instance().logEvent(AppStartEvent())
    }
}
```

### `LoginSuccessfulEvent`
Host app should log this every time the user logs in successfully.

```kotlin
InAppMessaging.instance().logEvent(LoginSuccessfulEvent())
```

### `PurchaseSuccessfulEvent`
Host app should log this event after every successful purchase.

```kotlin
InAppMessaging.instance().logEvent(PurchaseSuccessfulEvent()
```

### Custom event class:

### `CustomEvent`
Host app should log this after app-defined states are reached or conditions are met.

Custom events can have attributes with names and values. Attributes can be `integer`, `double`, `String`, `boolean`, or `java.util.Date` type.

* Every custom event requires a name(case insensitive), but doesn't require to add any attributes with the custom event.
* Each custom event attribute also requires a name(case insensitive), and a value.
* Recommended to use English characters only.
* Because the custom event's name will be used when matching campaigns with triggers; therefore, please make sure the actual campaign event's name and attribute's name must match with the logged events to InAppMessaging SDK.

```kotlin
InAppMessaging.instance().logEvent(CustomEvent("search").addAttribute("keyword", "book").addAttribute("number_of_keyword", 1))
```

**<font color="red">Please note:</font> Logging events may trigger InAppMessaging SDK to update current session data if there were changes in the app's user information (see [UserInfoProvider](#info-provider) section for details).**

## <a name="advanced"></a> Advanced Features

### <a name="context"></a> #1 Campaign's context
Contexts are used to add more control on when campaigns are displayed.
A context can be defined as the text inside "[]" within an IAM portal "Campaign Name" e.g. the campaign name is "[ctx1] title" so the context is "ctx1".
Multiple contexts are supported.
In order to handle defined contexts in the code an optional callback is called before a message is displayed:

```kotlin
InAppMessaging.instance().onVerifyContext = { contexts: List<String>, campaignTitle: String -> Boolean
    if /* check your condition e.g. are you on the correct screen to display this message? */ {
        true // campaign message will be displayed
    } else {
        false // campaign message won't be displayed
    }
}
```

### <a name="close-campaign"></a> #2 Close campaign API
There may be cases where apps need to manually close the campaigns without user interaction.

An example is when a different user logs-in and the currently displayed campaign does not target the new user.

It is possible that the new user did not close the campaign (tapping the 'X' button) when logging in. The app can force-close the campaign by calling the `closeMessage()` API.

```kotlin
InAppMessaging.instance().closeMessage()
```

**<font color="red">Note:</font> Calling this API will not increment the campaign's impression (i.e not counted as displayed).**

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a> Troubleshooting
<details>
<summary>proguard.ParseException (click to expand)</summary>

### `proguard.ParseException`

```kotlin
Caused by: java.io.IOException: proguard.ParseException: Unknown option '-if' in line 84 of file
This error will be thrown during compilation if `minifyEnabled = true`, and your Proguard version is below 6.0.
```

Recommendation: Update your project's Android Gradle Plugin to the latest version, it includes the latest version of Proguard.

Less optimal solution: Force Gradle to use the latest version of Proguard(https://sourceforge.net/p/proguard/discussion/182455/thread/89a4d63d/):

```groovy
buildscript {
    ...
    configurations.all {
      resolutionStrategy {
        force 'net.sf.proguard:proguard-gradle:6.0.3'
        force 'net.sf.proguard:proguard-base:6.0.3'
      }
    }
}
```
</details>

### Other Issues
Rakuten developers experiencing any other problems should refer to the Troubleshooting Guide on the internal developer documentation portal.

## <a name="faq"></a> Frequently Asked Questions
### Q: How do I send message for in staging or testing environment?
When creating campaigns, you can set the versions which the campaign will be applied to your app.
You can set the versions to staging versions (ex. 0.0.1, 1.0.0-staging, 0.x.x, etc.)

### Q: How many times In-App Message should be sent to test device? Does it depends on Max Lifetime Impressions?
The max impression is bind to per device ID.<br/>
1. Scenario- Max impression set to 2. User does not login with Rakuten ID or Easy ID. So It will be shown in single device for 2 times.
2. Scenario- Max impression is set to 2. User login with Rakuten ID or easy ID for 2 devices. It will show 2 times per devices.
3. The campaign start time can be shown

### Q: Is the campaign displayed if ALL or ANY of triggers are satisfied?
All the events "launch the app event, login event, purchase successful event, custom event" work as AND. It will send to the device only all defined event are triggered.
